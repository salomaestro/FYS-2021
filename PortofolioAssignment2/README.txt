This is a README for Candidate 25's solution to the tasks given in Portofolio assignment 2.

to run the code, first you will need to have the modules numpy, matplotlib, sklearn, pandas, math and os installed on your computer. You can in cmd or terminal write:

python -m pip install -U pip
python -m pip install -U matplotlib
python -m pip install numpy
python -m pip install os-sys
python -m pip install scikit-learn
python -m pip install pandas
python -m pip install math

The programs I have written are Problem1.py, Problem2.py, Problem3_ab.py and Problem3_c.py.

Problem3_ab.py also uses the LinearRegression class from ML_functions_PA.py.



To run the code correctly, put all files inside a common repository then execute the python files.

Theese programs also rely on the files given in the assignments collections of data.
