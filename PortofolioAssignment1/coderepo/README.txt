This is a README for Candidate 25's solution to the tasks given in Portofolio assignment 1.

to run the code, firstly you will need to have the modules numpy, matplotlib and os installed on your computer. You can use:

python -m pip install -U pip
python -m pip install -U matplotlib
python -m pip install numpy
python -m pip install os-sys

The programs I have written are problem1.py, problem2.py and ML_functions_PA.py

Both programs problem1.py and problem2.py heavily rely on ML_functions_PA.py to function, so this needs to be included no matter how you prefer to run the programs. To do this, put all files inside a common repository then execute the problem1.py and problem2.py programs as you wish.

The same programs also rely on the files given in the assignment collections of data.
