This is a README for Candidate 25's solution to the tasks given in Portfolio assignment 3.

To run the code, first you will need to have the modules numpy, matplotlib and os installed on your computer. You can in cmd or terminal write:

python -m pip install -U pip
python -m pip install -U matplotlib
python -m pip install numpy
python -m pip install os-sys

The programs I have written are Problem1.py and Problem2.py. Theese programs are the main part of my answers to this assignment. Problem1.py and Problem2.py uses the dataloader.py to import data from the current working directory (CWD). This means that to have both programs run properly, you must ensure the files:

- dataloader.py,
- city-inner-sweden.csv,
- city-names-sweden.csv,
- frey-faces.csv,

are all contained in the CWD. Then execute the code as usual.
